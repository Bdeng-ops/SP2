<h2>Personal Information</h2>
<p>I am a South Sudanese national who was born overseas. I speak Dinka which is the second most widely spoken language in Sudan. Last year, I graduated from Simonds Catholic College (high school), and this is my first year at university. One unique aspect of my personality is that I enjoy reading, whether it's for financial literacy or just for pleasure. In addition, soccer piques my attention.</p>

<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
<p>What interests me about IT is the broad impact it has. The fact that leading technology companies today can/have large scale impact on millions through their products and services is amazing to me. Impacts such as communicating to individuals across the globe through text or call on services like WhatsApp are very personal to me as I have relatives overseas, I frequently communicate with. Moreover, I have had that interest of being a part of that impact since I got my first phone at 13. Therefore, the large-scale impact that technology has interests me the most. 

The decision behind studying at RMIT is influenced by the location and individuals I know of. RMIT being in city played a key role in the decision as I can study and intake business activities outside of school without having to travel that much. 

I expect to learn programming languages such as python, Java, etc., which is fundamental for computing. I also expect to learn about information management and artificial intelligence. Furthermore, I expect to develop an overall understanding of information systems.

The concept of the protagonist makes them believe that they have a greater purpose in life. They are driven to serve others and make a difference in the world. Protagonists are born with charisma and passion. Their charisma allows them to motivate and inspire others. Relating to strengths, protagonists are receptive in recognising the importance of allowing others to express themselves even when they don’t agree with them.  Few things bother Protagonists more than the prospect of letting down a person or cause that they believe in, which assures their reliability. In terms of passion, protagonists are far from being boring do-gooders. They take great pleasure in pursing their hobbies. Moreover, determined and inspiring, Protagonists often find their way into leadership roles, placing charismatic as one of their strengths. 

However, in addition to strengths, Protagonists hold weakness. Protagonists are unrealistic as most often pressure themselves to right every wrong they encounter. It is not realistic for them to solve all the world’s problems. Another weakness Protagonists hold is intense. Protagonists are rarely short on energy or determination, but they may not recognise that not everyone shares these qualities. This lack of recognition may result in them pushing others to make changes that they aren’t ready for or not interested in. 

<h6>Workplace Habits</h6>

Warm, optimistic, charming, creative, and social protagonists. With the wind at their backs, Protagonists can excel in a wide range of roles and at any level of seniority.

<h5>Online learning style test</h5>

Personality Max Learning style test results: 85% visual learner, 79% kinesthetics, 69% Auditory. Biar Deng's Personality Max™ Report
Detailed results  
Learning Styles is a hypothesis that claims that varied styles of learning help people learn more effectively. We use our senses to take in information. Sight, hearing, and touch are the three most useful senses in a learning setting. Visual (V), Auditory (A), and kinesthetics (K) are classified as learning styles in the VAK paradigm.
Visual is my primary learning style. This style is learning by seeing, whether that be pictures, charts, diagrams, videos, etc. My primary learning style (visual) is determined by my ability comprehend visual information such as charts, graphs and diagrams, as well as appreciate pictures and illustrations in books. Moreover, my ability to recognise/ remember people’s faces more than their names and accurately recognize body language and facial expressions also plays a role in visual being my primary learning style. 
Kinesthetics is my secondary learning style. Kinesthetics is learning by doing. When you capture new knowledge through the process of physical action, you learn in this way. I am good at learning via hands-on experience which supports kinesthetics as my secondary learning style. Furthermore, I get satisfaction from building with my hands, adding to my kinesthetics learning style. 
Auditory is my least preferred learning style. Learning through ear is known as auditory style. An auditory learner can readily understand, process, and remember information during a lecture. This is my least preferred learning style as I often forget things, showed in my inability to accurately remember people’s names. 

<h5>Creativity Test: Curiosity, Imagination, Complexity, Risk Tolerance</h6>

Risk: 19/26
Curiosity: 19/24
Complexity: 15/26
Imagination: 13/24
Overall creativity score: 66/100


Risk involves exposure to danger from the uncertainty. When it comes to risk, I like to think positive of the outcome rather than negative. This places me in a position to handle the uncertainty adequately. Furthermore, in most cases, I calculate the risk and work on ways to reduce that risk to the lowest it can be. I, for example, am a stock trader. Risk is a significant component in the stock market. So, if I research a company and find it to be high risk, I either put a modest order or try to time the market to minimise risk. Therefore, my ability to minimize risk increases my capability of reducing errors in codes/programs in roles like IT support analyst. 

Curiosity refers to a great desire to learn more about something. Curiosity accounts for a significant portion of my personality. I'm always curious about how things operate. For example, as a youngster, I was always curious in how an automobile works. When I saw a YouTube video, my interest was piqued. As a result, curiosity can assist me in designing and developing programmes for modern-day solutions.

Complexity refers to the state of being elaborate or convoluted. When I find myself in a difficult position, I break it down and deal with it one step at a time. To increase my capacity to do complicated jobs, I enjoy playing strategy games. In addition, I like problem solving, which helps me deal with difficult situations and duties. As a result, my ability to deal with complexity can help me in my role as an IT support analyst, where I am frequently confronted with complicated tasks that programmers are unable to handle or often miss. 

Finally, my imagination may be beneficial in the realm of technology. Imagining things from a new perspective is something I do frequently. A common example I see is imagining how a website might appear if the theme colour was altered. Furthermore, I enjoy imagining various future possibilities, such as being the first to discover something new, such as a new software to solve an existing problem. Because AI is built on imagination, it plays a significant role in the tech sector.
